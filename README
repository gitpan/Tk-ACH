History
=======

Version: 0.04 08-Mar-2008
    o ptktrl shows eval result after sending input.

Version: 0.03

	o ptksh renamed to ptktrl.  There is now a better ptksh
	  available in Tk > V800.006.  ptktrl has the (only)
	  advantage that one can has on vi-editing mode when
	  Term::ReadLine::Gnu is installed.

	o Added t/basic.t tests: derived from Tk800 t/create.t

	o make 'o' command work as documented

Version: 0.02 09-Apr-1998

	o ptksh
		o POD updates and markup adapted to 'perl/Tk' standard
		o 'o' cmd extention:
		  -  rest of 'o' line splitted with split "". So
		     ptksh> o $w  opt1 opt2 ...    # accepts input like qw(...)
		  -  ptksh> o $w  /regexp/         # list all option of $w
							 matching regexp
		o ./.ptksh_init file sourced on startup
		o $ARGV[0] sourced on startup (please make sure there
		  is no MainLoop otherwise ptksh will hang)

	o FileEntry.pm & FcyEntry.pm
		o minor POD corrections additions
		o use Tk::<colname>() instead of hardcoded colors

	o ex/
		o added fcyentry example script

	o Start for application widgets (not ready for public)
		alpha/Tk/App.pm
		alpha/Tk/App/Main.pm
		alpha/Tk/App/Widget.pm
		...

Version: 0.01	19-Jan-1998

	o ptksh: added utility functions p, u, o to ptksh

	o FileEntry:  Creation of FileSelect is delayed until
	              it's really needed.
